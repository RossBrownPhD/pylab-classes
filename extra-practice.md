# Extra Practice and Troubleshooting

It can't be said enough -- one of the best ways to learn to code is to sit down and work on an exercise or project and learn as you go. You'll get lots of errors, but those are actually a great way to understand how Python works.

### Getting an error or want to learn about a specific topic?

Before you give up entirely, a simple Google search can often lead you to the answer to your problems. Finding the answers takes a bit of skill, though. It's a well-known secret that programmers need to be good at searching to find the right answers. Here's some tips for finding the best search terms and the best answers for your problem -

* If you're getting an error, type that exact wording of the error and ideally what you were doing to cause it.
* Know what you're working with. It can help to add which version of Python you're using, the Operating System, even things like the module you're working with.
* Be patient. Sometimes you have to look at a few different pages before you find a solution that works for you.
* Don't be afraid to look up words or concepts that are unfamiliar to you in an answer. It may seem daunting, but it's all part of learning to program.
* At this point it's a good idea to re-read your code. Sometimes you see a simple answer that you were missing before.
