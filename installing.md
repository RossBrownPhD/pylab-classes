# Resources - Installing Python

During class we'll frequently use the command line and a text editor, and it helps if you have these installed before coming to class. But if you're having trouble or don't have time, please come anyway!

## First, the Command Line

When learning Python you'll probably come across many references to the Command Line. What is it? How do you use it?

The answers to many of these questions can be found [here](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything). On Mac or Linux you're already set with Terminal or bash. To find Terminal on a Mac, look in the Utilities folder in Applications, or search for Terminal. Many versions of Windows come with Powershell, but you can also download it [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42554)

## Installing Python

#### Windows

Windows requires you to install Python, which can be confusing if you're new to programming. Below are a few guides to help you through the process:

* Download [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads#all), a Python distribution that comes with many of the most popular packages for analytics as well as Spyder, an interactive environment similar to what you're used to if you've used SaS, Stata, SPSS, or R Studio.

* [How-to-Geek's Guide to Installing Python](http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/), which includes screen shots documenting the steps, if you prefer visual guides.

* [The official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#installing-python), which has a couple of helpful links.

#### Mac

An older version of Python comes pre-installed with MacOS. All you need to do is open the Terminal application and type the following:
```
python
```
This will start Python in interactive mode, and everything else you type in the terminal window will be treated as Python code.

In order to install a more up-to-date Python, look into [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

#### Linux

This depends on the Linux distribution you're using, but it will most likely be installed.

### Text Editors

There are quite a few to choose from, but some of the most popular include:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)(Mac, Windows, Linux)

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)(Mac, Windows, Linux)

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)(Mac, Windows, Linux)

* If you're using Windows, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a great option.

* Experienced programmers might enjoy [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/index.php)
