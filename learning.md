# Resources - Learning Python

If you're looking at this, you're already taking steps to learn Python. Congratulations! Hopefully we'll see you at a PythonLab to learn more, but we know there's a wide range of interests, learning styles, and levels of commitment out there. That's why we put together a list of other resources for learning Python available online and in the DC area.

Try out a few, see what works for you! Let us know if you have any particular good or bad experiences with something of if we haven't listed a resource you like.

## Online Help

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - We frequently use this online book as a reference during the Saturday classes and it's also great for studying on your own. It's possible to purchase the book and access videos and other resources, but you can also use the book for free.

* [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html) - The organization Django Girls has a great tutorial that covers the basics of Python and how to use Python to build websites using Django.

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) - Codecademy provides instruction in a variety of programming languages covering many skills.

* [Google's Learn Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) - Google's introduction to Python. Note that it's designed for people who have done some programming before.

* [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/Python-training-tutorials/415-0.html) - If you have a DC Public Library card you can access Lynda.com for free, including tutorials on Python.

* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python) - Coursera offers a few courses on introductory Python. There are also several courses that involve using python for data analysis.

And there's always the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

There are too many blogs and tutorials out there to list here, though. And since often the best way to learn is just to do some coding, check out the page on [Extra Practice and Troubleshooting](www.github.com/necaris/pythonlab-classes/extra_practice.md)

## In-person Help

Going to Meetups is a great way to learn more about Python. Even if you feel like the topic is too advanced for you they're a great way to share ideas with other learners and expose yourself to new ideas.

* [DC Python](http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/) hosts numerous events, including the Saturday PythonLab and monthly office hours.

* [Django District](http://www.meetup.com/django-district/) has meetups that focus on the Django web framework for Python.

* [Data Community DC](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Community-DC/) organizes several events and workshops that often deal with using Python for data analysis

* [PyLadies](http://www.meetup.com/dc-pyladies/) is an organization for women who work with Python and want to learn more about it.

Several companies offer Python courses in the DC area, as well. We don't want to endorse any of them here, but please feel free to come to PythonLab and discuss options with others.
