# Pasadena Pylab-classes

This is the page for sample code and other resources for the Saturday Pasadena Python Lab.

Sample code and other assorted materials are sorted by date. There are also resources listed for [installing](http://pasadena-pylab.github.io/installing.html) and [learning](http://pasadena-pylab.github.io/learning.html) Python. It's a big help to everyone if you have Python and a text editor already installed when you come to class, but if you're having problems we'll do our best to sort you out!

NOTE: The class uses the current version of Python (Python 3). Don't worry if you already have Python 2 installed or are using it with another class or tutorial. We can work with both!

**If you have any questions please contact Nathan, the course instructor (through [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nate_somewhere), [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Pasadena-Python-Devs/members/30943492/), or [email](http://nathan.danielsen@gmail.com))**

### A few notes on why it's great to learn Python

:snake: It's free. You can download it for free, there are ways to learn it for free, and there's a whole range of packages available for free. There may be a time when you want to pay for classes, but you can get started without a major investment.

:snake: It's easy. Other languages make you remember strange commands or keep track of curly braces everywhere. Not so with Python. That makes it a great beginner programing language.

:snake: It's everywhere. It's a powerful language that is used by a wide variety of companies and organizations to solve all sorts of problems, including areas you don't think of as software problems. Python is used in large tech companies, political organizations, in academia and more.

:snake: It's community-focused. Python exists solely because of volunteers and has a great community both online and off that connects people. There are plenty of meetups here in DC and throughout the area, plus there are conferences around the world. The Python community is known for being open, encouraging, and welcoming to newcomers!

### A History of Python

* Created by Guido Von Rossum in 1991
* Currently on version 3+ but many people still use 2.7+
* Influenced by:
* C, C++, Dylan, Haskell, Java, Icon, Lisp, Perl, ABC, ALGOL, Modula-3

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:

    Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming
    project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas.
    My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on
    my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had
    been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers.
    I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent
    mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

### Core Philosopy ("PEP 20")

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Recommended Resources for Your Python Journey

### First Tier

[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
Learn python through small practical projects that might reduce the tedium in your job! (Highly recommended)

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
An equally good book and allows you to use python right in your browser.

[Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
Why not learn it the official way? This is a very indepth tutorial that will get you up and running!

[Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/)
If you're interested in cryptography, this is a highly recommended way to go.

[Flask Micro Blog Official Tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/tutorial/)
Feel comfortable with python and want to make a simple blog? Try flask. (Intermediate python required)

[Django Official Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/)
Dive into an opinionated web framework that has already made many decisions for you. Try django.  (Intermediate python required)

### Second Tier

[Learn Python the Hardway](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
A classic that many have used, but also a little snarky (if you like that). It's teaches legacy python 2.x, so be warned.

[Learn Python](http://www.learnpython.org/)
This website is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the Python programming language.

[Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)
Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.

[Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
More advanced but fantastic, it includes hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).

[A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182)
Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.

[DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/)
Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
